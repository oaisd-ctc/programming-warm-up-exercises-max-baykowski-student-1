## **C# Programming Warm-up Exercises**

Welcome back, seniors! As we kick off the year, let's warm up those programming muscles. Below are a set of exercises designed to get you back into the groove of C# programming. 

### **Objective:**
Each function in the provided C# file represents a unique problem. Your task is to complete the implementation of each function to ensure it works as expected. 

### **Instructions:**

1. **Understanding the Problems:**
    - Each function comes with a brief description of what it is supposed to achieve.
    - Review the function signature carefully. Pay attention to the input parameters and expected return type.

2. **Solving the Problems:**
    - Some functions have partial implementations, while others are empty. Complete each function based on its description.
    - Feel free to use any inbuilt C# libraries or methods that you think might help.
    - Remember, there's often more than one way to solve a problem. Strive for clarity and efficiency in your solutions.

3. **Testing:**
    - After implementing a function, make sure to test it! Think of various edge cases and scenarios to ensure your solution is robust.
    - Consider pair programming or discussing your solutions with a classmate (without directly copying) to gain new perspectives.

4. **Submission:**
    - Once you've completed all the exercises, commit and push your solutions to the repository.
    - Make sure to test all your functions one last time before the deadline.

### **Tips:**
- Don't be discouraged if you don't remember everything right away. Use this as an opportunity to review and research.
- Utilize online resources and documentation to help you when you're stuck.
- Collaboration is key! While you should not directly copy solutions, discussing problem-solving strategies with classmates can be very beneficial.

Happy coding, and let's have a fantastic year ahead!
